                <h4>Game Rules</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>You can play against the computer or another person.</li>
                    <li>The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. There
                        are 26 rounds in total. In each round, both players are
                        dealt a card. The player holding the card with the higher
                        rank wins 2 points, and the other player gains 0 points.
                        If both players hold two cards having the same rank, then
                        both players are awarded 1 point.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the game, the player with the higher score
                        wins. Of course, a tie is also a possibility.</li>
                    <li><code>ACE</code> is considered the lowest ranked card in
                        the game, while <code>KING</code> is the highest.</li>
                </ol>
